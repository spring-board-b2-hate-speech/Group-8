# Hate Speech Detection

This project focuses on detecting hate speech in text data using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The key tasks include tokenizing the text and generating embeddings using TF-IDF and Word2Vec. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Introduction

Hate speech detection is a crucial task in natural language processing, aimed at identifying and mitigating harmful content. This project implements text tokenization and various embedding techniques to preprocess and analyze text data.

## Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of splitting text into individual words or tokens. This project uses several tokenization techniques to handle the text data.

### Methods Used

1. **NLTK Tokenization**: A popular NLP library that provides a simple and efficient way to tokenize text.
2. **spaCy Tokenization**: An advanced NLP library offering fast and accurate tokenization.

### Code Example

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')  # Download necessary data for tokenization
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Sample text
text = "Hello, world! This is an example sentence."
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
