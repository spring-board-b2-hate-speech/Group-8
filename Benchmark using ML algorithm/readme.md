### Machine Learning Models
The following machine learning models were evaluated:

#### Random Forest
#### Logistic Regression
#### Naive Bayes
#### Support Vector Machine (SVM)


### Hyperparameter Tuning
For each model, we performed hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search to find the optimal parameters. This process helps in improving the model performance by selecting the best set of hyperparameters.

### Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the performance of the models, we used the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
AUC-ROC


### Findings
After extensive experimentation, the SVM model with TF-IDF embeddings provided the best performance. Here are the detailed results for the SVM model:
