# Hate Speech Detection in YouTube Comments

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI model to detect hate speech in YouTube comments. The model is trained using a labeled dataset and employs various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify and classify hate speech.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains YouTube comments labeled for hate speech. You can access the dataset from the following link:

[Hate Speech Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reihanenamdari/youtube-toxicity-data)

## Data Preprocessing

We used Google Colab for data preprocessing, which includes the following steps:
- **Tokenization**: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
- **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base or root form.
- **Normalization**: Converting text to a standard format, such as lowercasing and removing punctuation.

We used Google Colab for data cleaning and preprocessing. The preprocessing steps include data cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization to prepare the dataset for training the model.

## Usage

To preprocess the data, open the following Google Colab notebook:
